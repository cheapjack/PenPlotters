# Open Sourcing Pen Plotters for Microfluidics and Textile Making

![Eleksdraw](images/PaperDiagnosticPrinter.jpg)

Pen plotter work with @JackiePease and anyone else who's interested

Working on an Eleksdraw using the [grbl](https://github.com/robottini/grbl-servo]

Both need to have wax attachments based on [this Prusa Mod](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1677063) for potentially creating CNC/gcode controlled microfluidics channels and batik patterns.


It may be that if more people from @doesliverpool want to be involved then this repository would be better placed under @doesliverpool
